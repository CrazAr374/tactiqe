# Security Guidelines for Tactiqe Website

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Tactiqe website and provides guidelines for maintaining security standards.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Contact Form Validation**: All form inputs are validated for length, format, and content
- **HTML Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent XSS attacks
- **Email Validation**: Proper email format validation using regex patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints are protected against spam and abuse

### 2. Security Headers
The following security headers are implemented:
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy: origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restricts access to browser features
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Enforces HTTPS connections

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Restricts resource loading to trusted sources
- Prevents inline script execution (where possible)
- Blocks unauthorized external connections

### 4. Environment Variables
- Sensitive data stored in environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in the codebase
- Proper validation of environment variable presence

### 5. API Security
- Input validation on all API endpoints
- Error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information
- Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit sensitive data** to version control
2. **Validate all user inputs** on both client and server side
3. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
4. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
5. **Follow the principle of least privilege**

### For Deployment
1. **Set up proper environment variables** in production
2. **Enable security headers** at the server level
3. **Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** if possible
4. **Monitor for security vulnerabilities** in dependencies
5. **Implement proper logging** for security events

## Environment Variables Required

### Email Configuration (Choose one)
```bash
# Option 1: Gmail SMTP
EMAIL_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password

# Option 2: EmailJS
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your-service-id
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your-template-id
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-public-key
```
