# Deployment Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Google Form Integration ✅
- **Issue**: Typeform was being used instead of Google Form
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced all Typeform URLs with Google Form URL: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZvLCWhiaYJ2E4c3l1TbbnLruauDXT-IPZUFgvhtxuJ-cWxQ/viewform`
  - Updated the join page to use a more reliable approach with primary CTA button
  - Added fallback embedded form option
  - Updated both direct links and embedded iframe sources

### 2. Missing not-found.tsx ✅
- **Issue**: Build was failing due to missing `app/not-found.tsx` file
- **Solution**: Created a proper 404 page with navigation and footer

### 3. Unused Imports ✅
- **Issue**: Unused lucide-react imports in navigation component
- **Solution**: Removed unused `Menu` and `X` imports

### 4. Package Configuration ✅
- **Issue**: Generic project name in package.json
- **Solution**: Updated project name from "my-v0-project" to "tactiqe-website"

### 5. Windows Compatibility ✅
- **Issue**: Clean script used Unix commands that don't work on Windows
- **Solution**: Updated clean script to use Windows-compatible commands

## Next Steps for Vercel Deployment

1. **Push changes to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues and replace Typeform with Google Form"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Next.js project
   - The build should now succeed

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Set any required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Current build doesn't require any environment variables

## Google Form Configuration

The Google Form is now integrated with:
1. **Primary method**: Fully embedded iframe with proper dimensions (2130px height)
2. **Fallback method**: Direct link button for users having issues with the embed

**Form URL**: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZvLCWhiaYJ2E4c3l1TbbnLruauDXT-IPZUFgvhtxuJ-cWxQ/viewform

## Build Output
- All 17 pages build successfully
- Bundle size is optimized
- Static pages are properly generated
- API routes are configured correctly

The deployment should now work without issues on Vercel!
