## Next Steps

### 1. Vercel Will Auto-Deploy
Your changes have been pushed to GitHub. Vercel should automatically:
- Detect the new commit
- Start a new deployment
- Build successfully (we've tested this locally)
- Deploy your site

### 2. Monitor the Deployment
- Check your Vercel dashboard for the new deployment
- The build should complete successfully this time
- If there are any issues, they should be transient Vercel errors (not code issues)

### 3. Test Your Live Site
Once deployed, test:
- The "Apply Now" button (should open Google Form in new tab)
- The backup form (should submit via your contact API)
- Mobile responsiveness

### 4. Optional: Fix Google Form Settings
To completely remove the sign-in requirement from your Google Form:
1. Go to your form settings
2. Turn OFF "Collect email addresses"
3. Turn OFF "Restrict to users in your organization"
4. Make sure the form is publicly accessible

## What Users See Now

2. **Helpful Notice**: Yellow box explaining no Google account needed
3. **Multiple Options**: Users can choose their preferred submission method

5. **Smooth Experience**: No friction or barriers to application
